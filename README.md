# Objective

The objective of this assignment is for applying what we have learned so far in the class to create an app that allows the user to select news articles from topics they are interested in. We got the opportunity to navigate Android Studio and familiarize ourselves with the software to the point where we were able to create this app. We got to implement Recycle Views and intents to allow the user to click on buttons and take them to the correct screens and overall great functionality to the app. We also got to practice making the UI the designers intended us on creating which was difficult and took lots of tries but at the end, made the app look good. Overall, learned plenty and can't wait to see what will we have to create next.
